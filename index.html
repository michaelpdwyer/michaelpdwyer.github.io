            <p class="about">Thanks for stopping by! By day, I'm a Content Strategist for a Bellevue-based online travel
                technology
                company, meticulously developing and optimizing content that helps customers around book travel as
                effortlessly as possible. By night, I'm a student in the <a href="https://bootcamp.uw.edu/"
                    target="_blank">University
                    of Washington Coding Boot Camp</a> program. It's been a whirlwind experience so far, but I'm loving
                the challenge and couldn't be more excited for the opportunities that await me after completing the
                course. </p>
            <p class="about">My professional experience can best be summarized as an intersection of standard
                copywriting, line
                editing, writing for the customer experience, and just a dash of journalism. I plan to
                marry my existing content experience with newly acquired coding skills that empower me to build entire
                websites and apps from the ground up, covering as many aspects of the web development process as
                possible. </p>
            <p class="about">In my free time, I consume as many books, concerts, and Netflix comedy specials as I can,
                and spend more
                time than I'd like to admit on YouTube. My true passion, however, is travel. I take several trips per
                year both near and far (sometimes at barely a moment's notice), but being a born-and-bred Washingtonian,
                I always look forward to finding my way back to the Pacific Northwest. </p>
